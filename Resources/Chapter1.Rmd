## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Chapter 1 R code 
### Example 1.2 Xelox in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

This is a Phase II (single sample) clinical trial of Xeloda and oxaliplatin (XELOX)
chemotherapy given before surgery to 48 advanced gastric cancer patients with paraaortic
lymph node metastasis (Wang et al. [74]). An important survival outcome of
interest is progression-free survival, which is the time from entry into the clinical
trial until progression or death, whichever comes first. The data, which have been
extracted from the paper, are in the data set “gastricXelox” in the “asaur” package;
a sample of the observations (for patients 23 through 27) are as follows:


```{r}
library (asaur)
gastricXelox[23:27,]
```

### Example 1.3 Pancreatic cancer in patients with locally advanced disease

This is also a single sample Phase II study of a chemotherapeutic compound, and
the main purpose was to assess overall survival and also “progression-free survival”,
which is defined as the time from entry into the trial until disease progression
or death, whichever comes first. A secondary interest in the study is to compare
the prognosis of patients with locally advanced disease as compared to metastatic
disease. The results were published in Moss et al. [51] The data are available in the
data set “pancreatic” in the “asaur” package. Here are the first few observations:


```{r}
head(pancreatic)
```

### Example 1.4 Survival prospects of prostate cancer patients with high-risk disease

In this data set there are two outcomes of interest, death from prostate cancer and
death from other causes, so we have what is called a competing risks survival
analysis problem. In this example, we have simulated data from 14,294 prostate
cancer patients based on detailed competing risks analyses published by Lu-Yao
et al. [46]. For each patient we have grade (poorly or moderately differentiated), age
of diagnosis (66-70, 71-75, 76-80, and 80+), cancer stage ( T1c if screen-diagnosed
using a prostate-specific antigen blood test, T1ab if clinically diagnosed without
screening, or T2 if palpable at diagnosis), survival time (days from diagnosis to
death or date last seen), and an indicator (“status”) for whether the patient died
of prostate cancer (status = 1), died of some other cause (status = 2), or was
still alive at the date last seen (status = 0). The simulated data set matches the
original in the number of patients in each of the two grades, three stages, and four
age groups (24 categories). For each of the 24 categories, Lu-Yao et al. [46] also
presented competing risks survival plots for death from prostate cancer and from
other causes, and these 24 plots were used to simulate the data presented here. Thus,
the simulated data preserve many of the key characteristics of the original. This data
set, “prostateSurvival”, is available in the “asaur” package. Here is a list of the data
for a few patients (88–95):

```{r}
prostateSurvival[88:95,]
```

### Example 1.5 Comparison of medical therapies to aid smokers to quit

The purpose of this study (Steinberg et al. [63]) was to evaluate extended duration
of a triple-medication combination versus therapy with the nicotine patch alone in
smokers with medical illnesses. Patients with a history of smoking were randomly
assigned to the triple-combination or patch therapy and followed for up to six
months. The primary outcome variable was time from randomization until relapse
(return to smoking); individuals who remained non-smokers for six months were
censored. The data set, “pharmacoSmoking”, is available in the “asaur” package.
Here is a listing of a few cases and variables:


```{r}
pharmacoSmoking[1:6, 2:8]
```

### Example 1.6 Prediction of survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients using biomarkers

This study (Li et al. [42, 43]) focused on using expression of a chemokind
known as CXCL17, and other clinical and biomarker factors, to predict overall and
recurrence-free survival. This example contains data on 227 patients, each with a
wide range of clinical and biomarker values. The “hepatoCellular” data are publicly
available in the Dryad online data repository [43] as well as in the “asaur” R package
that accompanies this text. Here, for illustration, is a small selection of cases and
covariates.

```{r}
hepatoCellular[c(1, 2, 3, 65, 71),c(2, 3, 16:20, 24, 47)]
```
